# GoBanner
I wanted to learn go, so what better than to create somthing with it that you actually use.
I decided to rebuild bannergrab in Go as I wanted to extend this with more types of banners and that
at the same time was a good opportunity to learn Go.

## Download and install

### Using go get
`go get github.com/vdbaan/gobanner`
After this command gobanner is ready to use. Its source will be in:

`$GOPATH/src/pkg/github.com/vdbaan/gobanner`
You can use go get -u to update the package.
